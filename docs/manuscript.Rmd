# What explains differences in waiting times to speciation in vertebrates?

Type: Perspective

Possible traits:
- Body size
- Species range
- Generation time
- Latitude/Climate
- Pre/post zygotic isolation
- Temperature regulation
- What more?

Phylogenies:
- Mammals: Upham et al. 2020 PLoS Biol.
- Birds: Jetz et al. 2012 Nature
- Squamata: Tonini et al. 2016 Biol. Cons.
- Amphibians: Hime et al. 2020 Syst. Biol.
- Other herps: Colston et al. 2020 BMC Evol. Biol.

Approaches:
- MRCA age of all pairwise combinations of species
- Phylogenetic uncertainty
